## Help Wanted!

We currently only generate linear trend lines from two-dimensional data, but would welcome PRs for multivariate regressions and nonlinear regressions.

Also if you spot a doc error, please do open a PR!
I do not have a strong background in statistics, but I needed these functions so I wrote them.
The technical details of the explanations might be sub-par, and I would appreciate your help.

## Climate Action

I want my open-source activities to support projects addressing the climate crisis (for example, projects in clean energy, public transit, reforestation, or sustainable agriculture.)
If you are working on such a project, and find a bug or missing feature in any of my libraries, **please let me know and I will treat your issue as high priority.**
I'd also be happy to support such projects in other ways.
In particular, I've worked with Elm for a long time and would be happy to advise on your implementation.
