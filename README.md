## Help Wanted!

We currently only generate linear trend lines from two-dimensional data, but would welcome PRs for multivariate regressions and nonlinear regressions.

Also if you spot a doc error, please do open a PR!
I do not have a strong background in statistics, but I needed these functions so I wrote them.
The technical details of the explanations might be sub-par, and I would appreciate your help.
